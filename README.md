# Analyzing-Hotel-Booking-Data
This project involves analyzing hotel data from 2018, 2019, and 2020 to gain insights into hotel revenue growth, guest occupancy patterns, and other trends. The analysis is conducted using SQL Server for data analysis and Power BI for data visualization, providing dynamic and interactive visualizations.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used for this project contains hotel data from 2018, 2019, and 2020. It includes information on hotel revenue, guest occupancy, parking lot size, average daily rate, and other relevant metrics.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Determine if the hotel revenue is growing overall.
2. Analyze hotel revenue growth by year to identify trends and patterns.
3. Assess the need to increase the parking lot size based on the trend of guests with personal cars.
4. Explore additional trends in the data, with a focus on average daily rate and guest patterns to uncover seasonality effects.

## Tools Used
The project utilizes the following tools and technologies:
- SQL Server: Used for data analysis and querying the hotel dataset.
- Power BI: Used for data visualization and creating dynamic and interactive visualizations.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/DivyaKohli/hotel-revenue-analysis.git`
2. Set up the necessary dependencies and tools (SQL Server and Power BI).
3. Import the hotel dataset into your SQL Server database.
4. Execute the provided SQL queries to perform data analysis and address the key questions.
5. Connect Power BI to the SQL Server database and import the relevant tables.
6. Create visualizations in Power BI to analyze hotel revenue growth, guest occupancy patterns, parking lot size, average daily rate, and other trends.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of SQL Server for data analysis and Power BI for data visualization in the context of hotel revenue analysis. By examining hotel revenue growth, guest occupancy patterns, parking lot requirements, and other trends, the project provides valuable insights for decision-making and identifying opportunities for improvement. The dynamic and interactive visualizations created using Power BI enhance the understanding of the data and facilitate effective communication of the findings.
